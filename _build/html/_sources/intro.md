# Welcome to Pydra tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through the main concepts of Pydra!

## What is Pydra?

A simple dataflow engine with scalable semantics.

Pydra forms the core of the [Nipype](https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) 2.0 ecosystem. The goal of pydra is to provide a lightweight Python dataflow engine for DAG construction, manipulation, and distributed execution.
